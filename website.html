                  <p><strong>My theory:</strong> Finland does not exist. It's just "East Sweden". It's too easy to make up a country because no one will believe you. But the truth exists. </p>

                  <p><strong>Buckle up Buckaroos.</strong> "Well firstly they say that the actual 'place of Finland' is just Eastern Sweden. Helsinki is in Eastern Sweden and when people fly there it's not like they would notice.
World maps are altered as it's a U.N conspiracy to keep people believing in Finland. And the idea that an entire country is made up seems so bizarre that nobody would ever believe it, making it easy to do.
Finland's main company, Nokia, is apparently owned by the Japanese and they're a main player in this.
Now as for 'why' people would want to invent Finland as a country that's a bit more in depth and there's a few reasons as to why Sweden and Russia go along with it but it's mostly to do with Japanese fishing rights." --/u/Raregan </p>

                  <p> So essentially, Japan needed better fishing grounds in the 1960's and their fishing spots were running dry. Russia, who noticed this, decided to offer mutual help. The Soviet Union decided to let Japan
                    use the Eastern Sweden area to fish to their hearts content, transporting their goods through the Soviet Union as "Nokia" products. A small percentage is given to the Russian population, and it is shipped
                    to Japan. Japan is still currently the largest IMPORTER of Nokia products. However, one must ask themselves, <strong>how many people use Nokia phones anymore? And did you notice that the "country" is named FINland? </strong> </P>
